Fill the rest of the output grid with zeros.\\\\nFor example, in the first training example, the maximum number is 9. The maximum number is shifted to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the output grid is filled with zeros. Therefore, the output grid is:\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 9\\\\n0 0 9 0 0 9 0 0 0\\\\n9 9 0 9 9 0 0 0 0\\\\n9 0 9 9 0 9 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 9\\\\n9 9 0 0 0 0 9 9 0\\\\n9 0 9 0 0 0 9 0 9\\\\nnIn the second training example, the maximum number is 8. The maximum number is shifted to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the output grid is filled with zeros. Therefore, the output grid is:\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8\\\\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8\\\\n8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\\\\n8 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 8\\\\nnIn the third training example, the maximum number is 7. The maximum number is shifted to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the output grid is filled with zeros. Therefore, the output grid is:\\\\n0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 7 0 0 0 0 0 7 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n7 0 7 0 0 0 7 0 7\\\\nnFor the the test input, the maximum number is 1. The maximum number is shifted to the top-left corner of the output grid, and the rest of the output grid is filled with zeros. Therefore, the output grid is:\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\\\\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\\\\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\\\\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1\\\\n1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\\\\n1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1\"}"

This the transformation pattern that applies consistently to all training examples and can be applied to new test cases.\"}"

These regions can be found by looking for clusters of 8s that are connected diagonally (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).\\n\\n. For each region, find the smallest square of 8s that contains the entire region. This square should have sides of length equal to the size of the region (e.g., if a region has 3x8s, the square should be 3x3).\\n\\n. Within each region, shift all 8s to the top-left corner of the enclosing square. This can be done by moving the 8s to the top-left corner of the square and filling the remaining cells with 0s.\\n\\n. Repeat regions 1-3 for all regions in the input grid.\\n\\n. The resulting grid will be the output grid.\\n\\nFor example, in the first training example, the region of 8s in the top-left corner can be enclosed in a 3x3 square. The 8s are then shifted to the top-left corner of the square, resulting in the first output grid.\\n\\nThis process can be applied to all regions in the input grid to produce the corresponding output grid.\"}"

The third cluster has 18's in it, so it has 1 '8's. The fourth cluster has 18's in it, so it has 1 '8's.\\\\n\\\\n3. Replace each '8' in the cluster with the number of '8's in that cluster.

Replace all '0's in the input grid with '0's in the output grid. For example, in the first training example, all '0's in the input grid become '0's in the output grid.\\\\n\\\\n5. Replace all '8's in the input grid with '0's in the output grid.

Instead, we notice that the non-zero elements are replaced by the sum of their neighbors in the output grid, but only if the original element is greater than 4. If the original element is 4 or less, it is replaced by the corresponding element in the output grid. Therefore, the transformation pattern is as follows:\\n1.

If the current element is not zero, add it to the corresponding position in the output grid. If the current element is zero, find the next non-zero element to the right in the same row and add it to the current position in the output grid. If there is no next non-zero element to the right, add the first non-zero element found in the previous row to the current position in the output grid. Continue this process until all elements in the input grid have been processed.\"}"
